#+AUTHOR: Chris Charabaruk

The *html5-timestamp-helper* library provides HTML5 <time> tag export for timestamps from Org mode.
It provides transcoder methods for both Org's default HTML export backend as well as for the [[https://github.com/balddotcat/ox-slimhtml][ox-slimhtml]] export backend.

* Usage

Using this library to add <time> tag support requires defining derived export backends.
Depending on which backend you are using for HTML export, you should add one or both of the following blocks to your =init.el= file:

#+CAPTION: Derived backend for ox-html
#+begin_src elisp
(org-export-define-derived-backend 'custom-html
    'html
  :translate-alist '((timestamp . ox-html5-html-timestamp)))
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: Derived backend for ox-slimhtml
#+begin_src elisp
(org-export-define-derived-backend 'custom-slimhtml
    'slimhtml
  :translate-alist '((timestamp . ox-html5-slimhtml-timestamp)))
#+end_src
